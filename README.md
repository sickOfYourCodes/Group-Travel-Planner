## Description
This application is used for anyone to plan out group trips and hopes to provide users accessibility. The features included in this application are a calender with participant names, projected weather at designated locations, and budgeting amenities. This application is unique in its features. The motivations behind its design due to the lack of a usable application with similar features. 

While traveling, key aspects of the itinerary might be emitted due to inaccessibility or inconvenience, this app hopes to help users overcome this by providing a dashboard with a 50:50 view of the calendar and activities. When a user looks at the calendar section it lists out time blocks with descriptions and other participants' . 

When a user clicks into the time-block: time blocks with descriptions and participation icons. 
When a user clicks into the activity side: it includes details of the event, weather, and budget. 

When the website is generated for the first time, the user will see a homepage with website information and tutorials for use. 
If the user creates an account, they will have access to a profile page home page with the calendar and activity. 

This application is free of use.
